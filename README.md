freeCodeCamp OOP JS tutorial

As usual, another tutorial for OOP in JS. This one had used class keyword for OOP, which I am more inclined to use.
After all, it would get kinda confusing and this just seems better for later, when I start OOP in React.

What I do like more about this project is, that it gave you practical part. Usually tutorials just show you bunch of stuff,
and then expect from you to apply it in practical environment without you even knowing how to do that on most basic
level. This tutorial actually does that.

More or less, is not that hard to understand, but OOP is kinda important concept in programming and now I can actually practice it
and understand it.

Y'know, if you want to hate something properly, you gotta understand it first ;)


Onwards to another project!!!
